# Setup environment 

## IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for developing, testing, and debugging software.

An IDE typically includes a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, a debugger, and other tools for version control, testing, and project management. It is designed to provide a complete development environment within a single application, allowing developers to work more efficiently and effectively.

## Virtual environment config
Python virtual environment is a way to create isolated Python environments where you can install packages and dependencies without affecting the system's global Python environment. It allows you to work on multiple projects with different Python versions and dependencies without worrying about version conflicts.

By creating a virtual environment, you can create an isolated environment where you can install the packages specific to a particular project. This makes it easier to manage dependencies and avoids version conflicts that might arise when working with different Python versions and libraries.

### Anaconda
Conda is a cross-platform package and environment manager that installs and manages packages

## Console vs. script vs. vs. interactive python vs. jupyeter notebook
Python in terminal is a way to use the Python programming language directly in a command line interface. It allows you to enter code and get immediate results, making it useful for testing and experimenting with code.

Python script is a file containing Python code that can be executed from the command line. It allows you to write longer and more complex programs, which can be saved and executed later. Python scripts are useful for automation, data analysis, and many other applications.

Python interactive is a mode in which Python code can be entered and executed line by line in the terminal. It allows you to quickly test code and get immediate feedback on the results. Python interactive is useful for learning Python and testing small code snippets.

Jupyter notebook is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, and is widely used for data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning. Jupyter notebook is useful for creating reproducible research reports, tutorials, and interactive data visualizations.
