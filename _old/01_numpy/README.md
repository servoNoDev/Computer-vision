# 01. Numpy
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. It provides efficient storage and manipulation of large arrays of numerical data, making it easier to work with data in a variety of formats.


## Math entities
Scalars, vectors, matrices, and multidimensional matrices are all mathematical objects that are used in different fields, including linear algebra, physics, and computer science.

**A scalar** is a single number, such as 1, 2.5, or -3. It has no direction or orientation and can be represented by a single value.

**A vector** is an array of numbers arranged in a specific order. It has magnitude (length) and direction and can be represented graphically as an arrow. In two dimensions, a vector can be represented by a pair of numbers (x, y), while in three dimensions, it can be represented by a triplet of numbers (x, y, z).

**A matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It can be represented by a two-dimensional array, where each element of the array represents a single value in the matrix.

**A multidimensional matrix** is a matrix with more than two dimensions. It can be represented as an array of arrays, where each element in the array is itself an array representing a lower-dimensional matrix.
